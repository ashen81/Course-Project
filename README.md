# School project - HelpingBuy
A platform for shoppers outside of U.S. on their behalf to purchase international brands and ship to their home. 

## Purpose
There are tons of brands at all level, but not all the brands can be bought in Asia. Some websites even block their prices and clearance items when people do online shopping in Asia. Also, due to custom duties and policy factors, luxury goods in Asia are more expensive than in other countries. Therefore, our website provides shoppers especially who live in Asia to purchase merchandise with lower price at our website and ship to their countries.

## ToDo List
- Collect images of merchandise from its official website and upload to website
- List deals of popular brands that shoppers are interested
- Design a database with users, merchandise, and orders
